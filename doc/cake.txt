INTRODUCTION							*cake-introduction*

*cake* is for easy jumping between Controller, Model and View files when developing in CakePHP.

Requirements:
- Vim ver.7.0 or heigher
- CakePHP ver.1.3 or heigher


==============================================================================
INSTALL								*cake-install*

1: Extract the file and Put files in your Vim directory
   (usually ~/.vim/).
2: Execute |:Cakephp| <Space> /path/to/cakephp_app/ command or
let g:cakephp_auto_set_project = 1
let g:cakephp_app = "/path/to/cakephp_app/"
in your .vimrc.


And if you would like to use divided view themed such as "front" and "admin",
let g:cakephp_use_theme = "admin"
add the comment in your .vimrc.


MySQL and Apache logs to see the log quickly, and write the following.
>
    let g:cakephp_log = {
          \ 'query' : '/var/log/mysqld-query.log',
          \ 'access': '/usr/local/apache2/logs/access_log'
          \ }
<

Sorry, this plugin will not work well for windows at this time.


More comfortable to use cake.vim, if you write key-mappings in your .vimrc. 
Here is recommended key-mappings.
>
    " Recommended  key-mappings.
    nnoremap <Space>cc :Ccontroller 
    nnoremap <Space>cm :Cmodel 
    nnoremap <Space>cv :Cview 
    nnoremap <Space>cl :Clog
