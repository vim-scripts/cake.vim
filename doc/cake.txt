INTRODUCTION							*cake-introduction*

*cake* is for easy jumping between Controller, Model and View files when developing in CakePHP. 

Requirements:
- Vim ver.7.0 or heigher 
- CakePHP ver.1.3 or heigher


==============================================================================
INSTALL								*cake-install*

1: Extract the file and Put files in your Vim directory
   (usually ~/.vim/). 
2: Execute |:Cakphp| <Space> |/path/to/cakephp_root/| command or
let g:cakephp_auto_set_project = 1 
let g:cakephp_root = "/path/to/cakephp_root/"
in your .vimrc. 

And if you would like to use divided view themed such as "front" and "admin",
let g:cakephp_use_theme = "admin"
add the comment in your .vimrc. 


Sorry, this plugin will not work well for windows at this time.


More comfortable to use cake.vim, if you write key-mappings in your .vimrc. 
Here is recommended key-mappings.
